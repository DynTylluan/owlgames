Copyright (c) Respective owners

The problem with the world is that not everything is all that simple, the same
can be said about the license and copyright of each and every bit of software
in this collection. Not every bit of software here uses the exact same license
as the other, so please make sure that you take a look at the README files for
each WAD that you download, as some may restrict you from things such as being
able to modify the contents, while others are more liberal in nature.

If you spot a file that has an incorrect README file (or no file at all),
please inform us of the issue so that we may fix it.
