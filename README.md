# Welcome to the /owlgames archive
Welcome to the /owlgames archive, a collection of vanilla Doom WADs that can run on any port.

The idea of this collection is to be like the well-known [/idgames Archive](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames), but the main difference being is that all of the mods here are limited to being vanilla, being able to run in DOS and ports like [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org).

Currently we are located on [GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/owlgames) and [NotABug](https://notabug.org/DynTylluan/owlgames).
