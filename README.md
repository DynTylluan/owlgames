# Welcome To The /owlgames archive
Welcome to the /owlgames archive, a collection of vanilla Doom WADs that can run on any port!

The idea of this collection is to be like the well-known [/idgames Archive](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames), but the main difference being is that all of the mods here are limited to being vanilla only, meaning that they are able to run in DOS and ports like [Chocolate Doom](https://www.chocolate-doom.org).

Currently we are located on [GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan/owlgames) and [NotABug](https://notabug.org/DynTylluan/owlgames), the archive is ran by Cass "Owly" Python of [neozones.club](https://neozones.club).

## What We Want
In this archive, as you may have guessed, we want people to send in Doom WADs that can be run via _any_ port of Doom, so this means that they are able to be run in say, DOS with little to no trouble. We are more than happy to home a Doom mod that you found or even made yourself, but there are a few things that we are not okay with using...

## What We Don't Want
WADs that break one or more of the rules listed will be rejected from the archive.

* WADs that don't come with a README file (if you didn't make the WAD, you can [make one yourself](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?textmaker)).
* WADs that have been made to offend someone.
* Software that is just the full version of the Doom IWADs (don't want to buy Doom? Use [Freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io/)!)
* WADs that don't work in vanilla (duh)
* Anything that isn't packaged in a ZIP file (no 7-Zip or anything else, ZIP only!)

## Contact
If you want to bug the head of this collection for whatever reason, do feel free to send them a letter over on at [**E-Mail**](mailto:owlgal69@protonmail.com) or a better way to get in touch would be over on at Discord; **Owly#6604** - they won't bite!

## Fun fact
We are not associated with anyone, wow!
